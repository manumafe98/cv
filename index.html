                <h3>Cloud Engineer</h3>
                <p>As a skilled Cloud Engineer, I am responsible for developing and optimizing alarms to improve on-call duties, automating manual tasks, and implementing and enhancing the current architecture. My proactive approach includes reaching out to teams that do not have monitoring systems and implementing them, as well as working with teams that have implemented such systems to optimize them.</p>
                <p>To carry out these tasks, I utilize a variety of tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, Puppet, Terraform, Rundeck, and Python. My in-depth knowledge of these tools enables me to automate processes and enhance the performance of the cloud infrastructure.</p>
                <p>With a strong focus on improving system efficiency and enhancing user experience, I am committed to ensuring optimal cloud operations and providing unparalleled support to teams.</p>
